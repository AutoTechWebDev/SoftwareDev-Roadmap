# SoftwareDev-Roadmap
My personal roadmap to becoming a python software developer. Including all resources, projects, etc 
I maintained a consistent schedule of 2hrs per day a minimum of 5days per week (usually taking Thursday/Friday off from studying) totaling an estimated 10hrs consistently every week with sometimes more depending on my weekend work/life.
